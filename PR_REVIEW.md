Hi @biocodeit! üëã

Thanks for getting Playwright set up! This is a great start. I tested it locally and the basic test works well. However, I found a few issues that need to be fixed before merging.

**Required Changes:**

1. **CRITICAL - Workflow Filename Typo** üî¥
   - File: `.github/workflows/playwright.txtyml`
   - Issue: Extension should be `.yml` not `.txtyml`
   - Fix: Rename to `playwright.yml`
   - Why: GitHub Actions won't recognize the file with wrong extension

2. **package.json - Remove Unnecessary Dependency** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Line: `"playwright": "^1.56.1"` in dependencies section
   - Issue: Playwright should only be in devDependencies, not dependencies
   - Fix: Remove it from dependencies (it's already correctly in devDependencies)
   - Why: Production builds don't need test frameworks

3. **package.json - Revert Next.js Version** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Line: Changed `next` from `15.1.3` to `^15.5.6`
   - Issue: Unnecessary version upgrade for this PR
   - Fix: Revert to `"next": "15.1.3"`
   - Why: Keep this PR focused on E2E tests only

**Nice to Have (Optional for Future):**

4. **Test Robustness**
   - Current assertion uses exact text match which is brittle
   - Suggestion: Consider checking for key properties instead:
   ```typescript
   await expect(page.getByRole('presentation')).toContainText('"userId": 1')
   await expect(page.getByRole('presentation')).toContainText('"id": 1')
   await expect(page.getByRole('presentation')).toContainText('"title"')
   ```
   - This is more flexible if the API response changes slightly

**What's Good:** ‚úÖ
- Playwright config follows best practices
- Test structure is correct
- .gitignore changes are appropriate
- Smart to start with just Chromium

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix the 3 required changes above
2. Push the updates
3. I'll review again and merge!

Once this is merged, you can proceed with adding more test scenarios from the issue. Great work so far! üöÄ

Let me know if you have any questions about the changes needed.

Best,
Daniel
