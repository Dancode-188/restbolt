# ðŸ“‹ How to Create GitHub Issues

This directory contains 4 pre-written GitHub issues that you should create for RestBolt's roadmap.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Option A: Copy-Paste Method (Easiest)

1. **Go to GitHub:**
   Visit: https://github.com/Dancode-188/restbolt/issues/new

2. **For each issue file:**
   - Open one of the `.md` files in this directory
   - Copy the entire content (excluding the first line with labels)
   - On GitHub:
     - Paste the content into the issue description
     - Add the labels mentioned at the top of the file
     - Click "Submit new issue"

3. **Repeat for all 4 issues:**
   - `01-graphql-support.md` â†’ Create issue
   - `02-mock-server.md` â†’ Create issue
   - `03-test-coverage.md` â†’ Create issue
   - `04-documentation-improvements.md` â†’ Create issue

### Option B: Using GitHub CLI (Faster)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
cd C:\Users\user\restbolt\.github\ISSUES_TO_CREATE

# Create each issue
gh issue create --title "[Feature] Add GraphQL Support" --body-file 01-graphql-support.md --label "enhancement,graphql,good first issue"

gh issue create --title "[Feature] Add Mock Server" --body-file 02-mock-server.md --label "enhancement,mock-server,testing"

gh issue create --title "[Testing] Add Comprehensive Test Coverage" --body-file 03-test-coverage.md --label "testing,quality,good first issue"

gh issue create --title "[Documentation] Improve Documentation & Examples" --body-file 04-documentation-improvements.md --label "documentation,good first issue,help wanted"
```

## After Creating Issues

### 1. Pin Important Issues
On GitHub, you can pin up to 3 issues. I recommend pinning:
- Documentation Improvements (helps new contributors)
- Test Coverage (shows project maturity)
- GraphQL Support (most requested feature)

### 2. Add to Project Board (Optional)
Create a GitHub Project board to track progress:
- Todo
- In Progress
- Done

### 3. Create Milestones
Organize issues into milestones:
- **v0.2.0** - GraphQL + Docs
- **v0.3.0** - Testing + Mock Server
- **v1.0.0** - Production ready

### 4. Enable Discussions
Go to repository settings and enable GitHub Discussions for:
- Feature requests
- Q&A
- Community ideas

## Issue Template Files Explained

After creating these 4 issues, the template files in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` will:
- Automatically appear when someone creates a new issue
- Provide structured forms for bug reports and feature requests
- Make it easier for contributors to provide useful information

---

## Next Steps After Issues Are Created

1. **Commit the templates:**
   ```bash
   git add .github/
   git commit -m "docs: add GitHub issue templates and roadmap issues"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Share on social media:**
   - Tweet about your project with the issues link
   - Post on Reddit (r/webdev, r/opensource)
   - Share in Discord/Slack communities

3. **Label as "good first issue":**
   - Test coverage has many small, beginner-friendly tasks
   - Documentation improvements are perfect for first-time contributors
   - This attracts new contributors!
